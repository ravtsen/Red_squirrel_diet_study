# Red_squirrel_diet_study
TripleTen Sprint 8 project

There is a [Dataset](https://github.com/ravtsen/Red_squirrel_diet_study/blob/main/squirrel_diet.csv) and a figure provided by [TripleTen](tripleten.com).<br/> 
The aim of the [Project](https://github.com/ravtsen/Red_squirrel_diet_study/blob/main/Red_squirell_diet_study.ipynb) is to use either seaborn or plotly to recreate the figure using the dataset.<br/>

The dataset contains the results of a mock study where 100 red squirrels were given one of three different diets after weaning, and their full grown adult weights were recorded. The figure below displays the results of the study, and this is the figure that need to be recreated.
